📘 Project Overview

This project is part of the **ALX Front-End Web Development program**, designed to introduce learners to the **foundations of HTML** — the standard markup language for creating web pages.

Through this project, I learned how to structure a webpage using semantic HTML elements, create navigation links, embed multimedia, and organize content effectively to improve accessibility and user experience.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I am able to:

- Explain what **HTML** is and how it works.
- Create valid and well-structured **HTML pages**.
- Use **tags** and **attributes** correctly to organize web content.
- Understand what a **markup language** is and its role in rendering web pages.
- Build basic web pages like personal bios, lists, and simple documents.

## 🧱 Project Structure

This repository contains two main folders:

### **1. `html_basic/`**

This folder contains simple HTML exercises that demonstrate understanding of core concepts such as structure, navigation, and tables.

**Files include:**

- `base_index.html` → The most basic valid HTML file with DOCTYPE, head, and body.
- `index.html` → A simple webpage with headings, paragraphs, and a clickable image.
- `tweets.html` → A webpage embedding a tweet and linking back to the homepage.

**Website structure (consistent across pages):**

```html
<body>
  <header>...</header>
  <main>
    <article>...</article>
    <aside>placeholder to add comment thread later</aside>
  </main>
  <footer>
    Made by Kessiena Arhata-Obehi -
    <a href="https://your-link.com" target="_blank">here</a>
  </footer>
</body>
```

**Additional Features:**

- Basic navigation bar using `<ul>` and `<li>` links inside `<header>`.
- A table of learners included in `index.html`.

Example table:

| Name    | Age | Country   |
| ------- | --- | --------- |
| John    | 25  | USA       |
| Emily   | 28  | Canada    |
| Michael | 32  | Australia |
| Sophia  | 21  | UK        |
